# Working with Altera Quartus II (Q2) and do proper versioning is not that easy
# but if you follow some rules it can be accomplished. :)
# This file should be placed into the main directory where the .qpf file is
# found. Generally Q2 throws all entities and so on in the main directory, but
# you can place all stuff also in separate folders. This approach is followed
# here. So when you create a new design create one or more folders where your
# entities will be located and put a .gitignore in there that overrides the
# ignores of this file, e.g. one single rule stating "!*" which allows now all
# type of files. When you add a MegaFunction or another entity to your design,
# simply add it to one of your private folders and Q2 will be happy and manage
# everything quite good. When you want to do versioning of your generated
# SOF/POF files, you can do this by redirecting the generated output to an own
# folder. To do this go to:
# "Assignments"
# -> "Settings
# -> "Compilation Process Settings"
# -> "Save project output files in specified directory"
# Now you can either place a .gitignore in the directory and allow the following
# list of types:
# !*.sof
# !*.pof
# or you create an own submodule in the folder to keep binary files out of your
# design.

# Need to keep all HDL files
# *.vhd
# *.v
